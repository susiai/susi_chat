# susi_chat

We implement a chat interface to communicate with a LLM. The following ways of communication are possible:

- using a command-line console within your Linux/Mac/Windows terminal
- using a command-line console within a Browser using Javascript to simulate the same environment that you can experience with the terminal
- using a voice interface: console inputs are done via speech recognition and responses are done either on a console or using text-to-speech

All of those options shall be possible either on a normal computer or using a Raspberry Pi
which also should be able to show that the whole operation is done without internet connection.

## Running a chat server

We need a LLM as back-end for the chat. We use llama.cpp for this. To run the server, do:

```shell
# clone and build llama.cpp (do this just once)
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
cd llama.cpp
make

# get model (here: one which can run on a Raspberry Pi 5, do this just once)
curl -o models/openchat-3.5-0106.Q2_K.gguf https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/openchat-3.5-0106-GGUF/blob/main/openchat-3.5-0106.Q2_K.gguf

# run the model
./server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 -ngl 0 --path ../susi_chat/chat_terminal/ -m ~/models/openchat-3.5-0106.Q2_K.gguf
```

.. to run llama.cpp with the mixtral model hosting also susi_chat at http://localhost:8001
